OSU vs Michigan is the BIGGEST game of the year...well, if you are a buckeye fan. Personally, i am not a buckeye fan
and find game times are the best to run errands and not worry about crowds.  I do wish for OSU to win on this particular
day.  If they lose there are a lot of grumpy people around town.
